# Packet_sniffer
Packet sniffer is a very useful tool developed to sniff and examine data packets that is sent in your network. This sniffer is tested and it is able to capture all the http req and resp packets that where sent in the same network.
and if have undestand the code than u can configure it in your ways to sniff data.Like i did to sniff id and passwords of my college students who were trying to login to my collges http login portal by configuring and changing some code in it.
but i dont think that will work for every website so i didnt shared it here.Hope you enjoy this.
python or python3 both will work.
